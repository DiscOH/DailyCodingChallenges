This is a question about counting.
You are given an list of positive integers.
Starting from index 0, you take the value of your current location and move forward in the list up to that distance.
Example:
[3, 2, 4, 5, 4]
Starting at index 0 (value = 3).
You could move up to 3 spaces to the right (to index 1, 2, or 3) but not to index 4 [>, 2, 4, 5, X]

You repeat this pattern until you win or lose.

You win if the index you move to is outside the bounds of the list.
You lose if:
1 - You land on the final index in an list.
2 - You land on a 0 (you're stuck)

[6, 1, 1] is winnable
[6] is not winnable
[1, 0] is not winnable
[1, 1, 3] is not winnable

INPUT:
A list of positive integers

OUTPUT:
List
If winnable, any valid path, listed by the index used.
else an empty list
